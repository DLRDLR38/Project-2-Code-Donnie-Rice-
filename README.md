Robotic Arm_Electromagnet_Program: Arduino program created to command the robotic arm to move into place and turn the electromagnet off/on
Load_Sensor_Alarm_Program: Arduino program created to measure the weight placed on the sensor and record the analog voltage input; as well as, sound a beeping alarm.
xArmServoController.cpp/xArmServoController.h: C++ and header files included into the Robotic Arm_Electromagnet_Program that allows the use of functions to command the robotic arm through Arduino.
